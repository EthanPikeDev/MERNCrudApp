# Full-Stack MERN CRUD Application

# Summary: 

This is a full stack application built with the MERN Stack (React.js, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB). Cars can be added to the MongoDB database using the react User Interface.
These items get added to the "schemaless" NoSQL database and can then be edited or deleted as needed. This is just a simple CRUD application to practice some of the skills
I have learned during my bootcamp.

2. Run "npm install" in the root folder to install the node modules for the backend.

3. Navigate to the client directory.

4. Run "npm install" again to install the node modules for the front end of the application.

5. Navigate back to the root folder to start the project. IE "cd .."
